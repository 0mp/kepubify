html

This is a fork of golang.org/x/net/html which includes additional
features and modifications required by kepubify.

Prior to kepubify v4, the modifications were replaced using a go.mod
directive, with the code stored in github.com/pgaskin/net. The git
history there has been preserved under the branch
pgaskin/kepubify/pre-v4.
