# Seriesmeta
A standalone command to update the series metadata on Kobo eReaders. Only works with books stored in the internal memory. Only works on macOS and Linux for now. Works with epub and kepub based on the Calibre series metadata.

Updates the series metadata for all sideloaded kepubs.

Examples:
- `./seriesmeta /path/to/KOBOeReader`
