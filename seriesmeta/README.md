# Seriesmeta
A standalone command to update the series metadata on Kobo eReaders. Only works with books stored in the internal memory. Works with epub and kepub based on the Calibre series metadata. Will work even before importing books.

Updates the series metadata for all sideloaded kepubs.

Examples:
- `./seriesmeta /path/to/KOBOeReader`
